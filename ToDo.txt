Add a history drop down list
 - When user searches something up store it in list and there will be a drop down that says "history." When it is pressed with nothing in the list it will say "seems like you havent searched anything try pasting a link." When there are items in the list it will display the 5 newest items. Animation for drop down: when pressed items come down like a ladder. 

        should i keep copy link or should i add article favicon

        pros: looks cleaner and can take user to website

        cons: extra steps for user (has to press copy link and paste it themselves)

 Fix array system:
 - Store max 5 items, when a 6th item is added delete the oldest item. Stack system. 

 Fix clear all button:
- make it look cleaner, blurred button background with better font

Add x button:
- if user does not want to clear the whole list they can press x on the item they want to remove
